## Our project consists of two main parts:
- Part I: face verification system in a smart home typically involves capturing an image of the person's face, either through a camera or a device such as a smartphone, and comparing it to a pre-registered image of the person's face. If the images match, the person is granted access to the home. If the images do not match, access is denied.
- Part II: surveillance cameras in the streets is to monitor and improve public safety and security.

- #### Currently, we are still working on updating the deployment of our project using the Streamlit app.
